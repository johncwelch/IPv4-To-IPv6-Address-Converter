I hate github so much
I want to find the person who decided that I have to create the readme, the .gitignore or whatever the hell they decided that i simply HAVE TO CREATE BEFORE I can upload the code the gods-damned repository is for.

THis shouldn't be surprising. Because why should things be easy? If it was easy, anyone could do it, and Github is all about keeping the proles out.

God, But I hate these precious twee hipsters.
